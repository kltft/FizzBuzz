# FizzBuzz

## This is an implementation of FizzBuzz, a common coding interview question/test

Typically FizzBuzz consists of the following requirements:
* Print the integers 1 - 100
* When the integer is divisible by 3, then print Fizz
* When the integer is divisible by 5, then print Buzz
* When the integer is divisible by 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz
* If none of the above is true, then print the integer 

This implementation is written as a console application in .NET, and includes a test project included in the .NET solution.
